# supermarket_db

Extension for paper: http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-1433/tc_74.pdf

Prolog is well suited for code development in areas that require working with,  managing and analyzing high volume of data. In this project I present supermarket_db, which is a system implemented in Prolog that gives easy access to high quality data in the format of Prolog fact files. I have extended the paper to not only work with biological datasets but another one too i.e. Supermarket datasets. Moreover, I have evaluated their work and verified their claims for both cases of bio_db and how they apply to supermarket_db.
